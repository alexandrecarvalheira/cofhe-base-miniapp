# Numberle FHE Game - Development Roadmap

## Overview
Transform the current Numberle game into a fully on-chain, encrypted game using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). This will demonstrate the power of FHE technology while providing an engaging gaming experience.

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic UI implementation complete
- ✅ Game mechanics working (local state)
- ✅ Visual feedback system
- ✅ Equation validation

## Game Design Updates

### Core Mechanics Changes
- **5-tile rows** instead of 7 (removing = sign and result display)
- **Left-side equation only**: Players guess the mathematical expression (e.g., "12+34")
- **FHE result comparison**: Use `fhe.comparator` to provide "higher/lower" feedback instead of showing exact result
- **Number presence feedback**: Show if digits appear in the equation (not considering result side)
- **No position hints**: Don't reveal exact positions, only whether numbers exist in the target equation

### Enhanced Privacy Model
- **Hidden equation structure**: Target equation remains completely encrypted
- **Comparative feedback only**: Players receive "result too high/low" hints via FHE comparison
- **Minimal information leakage**: Only reveal digit presence, not positions or exact values

## Core FHE Integration Goals

### Phase 1: Smart Contract Foundation
- [ ] Deploy Numberle smart contract on Fhenix network
- [ ] Implement 5-tile equation format (no = sign)
- [ ] Create encrypted target equation generation (left-side only)
- [ ] Store player attempts on-chain with FHE encryption
- [ ] Implement FHE comparator for result validation

### Phase 2: Encrypted Game Logic
- [ ] **FHE Equation Evaluation**: Calculate equation results using encrypted arithmetic
- [ ] **FHE Result Comparison**: Use `fhe.comparator` to determine if guess result is higher/lower than target
- [ ] **Encrypted Digit Presence Check**: Verify if digits exist in target without revealing positions
- [ ] **Private Score Calculation**: Calculate scores using encrypted arithmetic operations
- [ ] **Minimal Feedback System**: Provide only essential hints without compromising privacy

### Phase 3: Advanced FHE Operations
- [ ] **Multi-player Support**: Multiple players can play simultaneously without seeing others' progress
- [ ] **Encrypted Leaderboards**: Rankings based on encrypted scores and completion times
- [ ] **Private Statistics**: Track player performance without revealing individual game data
- [ ] **Encrypted Daily Challenges**: Generate daily puzzles that remain hidden until completion

## FHE Use Cases to Demonstrate

### Core Cryptographic Operations
1. **Encrypted Comparison**: Compare guess characters with target without revealing target
2. **Encrypted Arithmetic**: Validate mathematical equations using FHE operations
3. **Encrypted Conditionals**: Implement game logic decisions on encrypted data
4. **Encrypted Counters**: Track attempts, scores, and progress privately

### Privacy Features
1. **Private Game Sessions**: Players' guesses remain private until game completion
2. **Anonymous Leaderboards**: Rankings without revealing player identities
3. **Encrypted Matchmaking**: Pair players based on skill level without exposing stats
4. **Private Achievement System**: Unlock rewards based on encrypted performance metrics

## Technical Implementation Ideas

### Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
contract NumberleFHE {
    // Encrypted target equation (5 characters, no = sign)
    euint8[5] private targetEquation;
    
    // Encrypted target result for comparison
    euint32 private targetResult;
    
    // Player game states
    mapping(address => GameState) private playerStates;
    
    // Encrypted leaderboard
    mapping(uint256 => euint32) private encryptedScores;
    
    struct GameState {
        euint8[6][5] attempts;  // 6 attempts, 5 characters each
        euint8 currentAttempt;
        bool gameComplete;
    }
    
    function makeGuess(euint8[5] memory guess) external {
        // Evaluate guess equation using FHE arithmetic
        euint32 guessResult = evaluateEncryptedEquation(guess);
        
        // Compare with target using FHE comparator
        ebool isHigher = FHE.gt(guessResult, targetResult);
        ebool isLower = FHE.lt(guessResult, targetResult);
        
        // Check digit presence without revealing positions
        bool[10] memory digitPresence = checkDigitPresence(guess);
        
        // Update game state
        updateGameState(msg.sender, guess, isHigher, isLower, digitPresence);
    }
}
```

### Game Mechanics Enhancements
- **Range-based Hints**: Provide encrypted ranges (e.g., "result between 50-100") without exact values
- **Digit Pool Strategy**: Players must deduce which digits are used vs unused
- **Operator Frequency**: Show how often certain operators appear (encrypted counters)
- **Progressive Hints**: Each wrong guess unlocks additional encrypted information
- **Bracket Challenges**: Complex equations with parentheses for advanced players
- **Time Pressure**: Encrypted timers with bonus points for speed
- **Combo System**: Bonus multipliers for consecutive correct guesses

### Additional FHE Game Ideas
- **Encrypted Auctions**: Bid on hint reveals without showing bid amounts
- **Team Competitions**: Collaborative solving with private individual contributions
- **Difficulty Scaling**: AI adjusts complexity based on encrypted skill assessment
- **Meta-puzzles**: Solving multiple equations reveals larger encrypted message
- **Achievement Trees**: Unlock paths based on encrypted performance metrics
- **Seasonal Events**: Limited-time challenges with encrypted reward pools

### Social Features
- **Encrypted Chat**: Players can communicate without revealing game state
- **Private Rooms**: Create encrypted game rooms for friends
- **Tournament Mode**: Bracket-style competitions with encrypted brackets
- **Spectator Mode**: Watch games without seeing the solution
